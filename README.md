Just a bunch of scripts used in home automation.
- Use [stream2chromecast](https://github.com/aiolos/stream2chromecast) to use bash and python
 for sending streams to a Chromecast
- Use [ESPEasy](https://github.com/aiolos/ESPEasy) for send IR commands to receivers and televisions
- Various LUA scripts to react on events in Domoticz

Most of these scripts communicate with [Domoticz](www.domoticz.com).
